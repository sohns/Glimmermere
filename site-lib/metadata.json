Let me just start with this... Markdown is very easy to both use and learnIf you have come from a tool like Word or OneNote, you are probably used to seeing a toolbar that has all your options for changing the Font, Bold, Underline, Italics, etc. Obsidian does not have this bar which sometimes creates panic in new users. People are naturally afraid of change.\nObsidian does not have this bar though... because you don't need it. What Is Markdown\nThe non-technical way to explain Markdown... It's basically a way to take plain-text and make it look pretty.\nIt lets you apply Themes on your plain text notes!\nIf you still need a format bar\nThen you can install them via the community plugins.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=editing-toolbar\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"./obsidian:/show-plugin?id=editing-toolbar\" target=\"_self\">Editing Toolbar</a> or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-markdown-formatting-assistant-plugin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"./obsidian:/show-plugin?id=obsidian-markdown-formatting-assistant-plugin\" target=\"_self\">Markdown Formatting Assistant</a> will add some toolbar options. They might help you learn Markdown initially while you find you need them less and less and you gain confidence. Headings are very easy to do. Simply type `# space heading name.\nYou can add more #'s to change the size of the Heading.\nHeadings can also fold under each other. That means you can expand/fold a heading and all content under that heading leaver will be impacted. If you fold a level 1 heading that has level 2 and 3 headings/content under it, then all of the level 1, 23 and 3 content will fold with it. Example\n“Obsidian_RrEKxtUpcc.gif” could not be found.\nTry by copying the following into a note. # This is a heading 1\nYou can type your content under the headings ## This is a heading 2\n### This is a heading 3 #### This is a heading 4\n##### This is a heading 5\n###### This is a heading 6\nYou can BOLD text simply by highlighting it and pressing Ctrl+B.\nAlternatively you can make text BOLD by typing at the start and the end of the text you wish to BOLD**. **This text will be bold**\n__This will also be bold__\nYou can ITALICS text simply by highlighting it and pressing Ctrl+I.\nAlternatively you can make text ITALICS by typing at the start and the end of the text you wish to ITALICS*. *This text will be italic*\n_This will also be italic_\nUnderline is not supported by Markdown.\nSorry to be the one to tell you this. I know it hurts. HTML Underline\nIf you absolutely can't live without Underline, then Obsidian also supports HTML so you can do this:\nExample: This is some&nbsp;&lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;&nbsp;text.\nAnything between the and will be underlined. Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.\nAny word wrapped with two tildes (like this) will appear crossed out.Use two equal signs to ==highlight text==.\nUse two equal signs to highlight text.Linking to other notes can be done very easily.\nExample: [[NoteName]]If you want to show a custom name for the link you can add a pipe | after the NoteName and type the new name for the link.\nExample: [[NoteName|NewLinkName]]You can also link to a sub-section of a note. Sections are created using # Headings.\nExample: [[NoteName#HeadingName]]Markdown style links can be used to refer to either external objects, such as web pages, or an internal page or image.http://obsidian.md - automatic!\n[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md)\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://obsidian.md\" target=\"_self\">http://obsidian.md</a> - automatic!<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://obsidian.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://obsidian.md\" target=\"_self\">Obsidian</a>You can link to YouTube videos like this also. This will render the YouTube video in side your note. ![](Youtube.com)\nInstead of having just a link to a note; you can embed it in your note.\nExample: ![[NoteName]]This works with sub-sections too.\nExample: ![[NoteName#HeadingName]]Obsidian recognizes the following file formats right now:\nMarkdown files: md;\nImage files: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, svg;\nAudio files: mp3, webm, wav, m4a, ogg, 3gp, flac;\nVideo files: mp4, webm, ogv;\nPDF files: pdf.\nAll these types of files can be embedded in a note.<br>See <a data-href=\"How To - Add Images\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">How To - Add Images</a> - Item 1\n- Item 2 - Item 2a - Item 2b 1.
